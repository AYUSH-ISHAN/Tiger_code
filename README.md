 # Preface 
Obtaining dynamic skills for autonomous machines has been a cardinal challenge in robotics. In the
field of legged systems, many attempts have been made to attain diverse skills using conventional
inverse kinematics techniques. In recent years, learning-based quadrupedal locomotion has
been achieved by reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to address more complex environments
and improve performance. However, the demand for acquiring more highly dynamic
motions has brought new challenges to robot learning. A primary shortage of motivating desired
behaviors by reward engineering is the arduous reward-shaping process involved. It can sometimes
become extremely demanding in developing highly dynamic skills such as jumping and backflipping,
where various terms of motivation and regularization require elaborated refinement.
